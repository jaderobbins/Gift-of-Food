First of all, we would like to thank you for your dedication and commitment to this exciting event! We are looking forward to the 6th Annual Spring For Food - Food Drive and hope to achieve our goal of raising 25,000 pounds of food!   Below is a detailed outline of what to expect related to the event:

Day of the event: April 16th, 2016
Time of Event: The event will officially begin at 10am and last until you finish (2-3 hrs).

Check-in Time and Location: Due to the amount of coordination, we ask that all team leaders show up at between 9:30am-10:30am to collect their lanyards/badges at their assigned drop off location.  We will let you know your drop-off location a week or so before the event.

Lanyards:
* Lanyards with volunteer badges will be distributed the day of the event. Please wear these throughout the morning and ensure they are visible (should be worn on the outside of your jacket/coat).
* We would like to collect the lanyards at the end of the event and there will be a "Lanyard Return" box at your designated drop off location
Maps
* Maps were sent to you by email.  Please print a copy of the map for your team members.  The Drop-off locations will have copies of the maps, but it will be easier if you have your printed copy.

Emergency Phone number:
In the event of emergency, please call one of the Event Leads:
* Gallatin Valley Food Bank: 406-586-7600
* Justin: 406-539-6151
* Amanda: 406-460-2233

Team structure:  Teams can range in size from two people to however many you want –four- five people per team has been recommended in past years.  Ideally, there would be one "designated driver" to help transport all of the food that is collected.  Please be sure to keep in touch with your team throughout the event.   Please feel free to take more than one pick up area if your team size allows.

Drop-Off Locations: There will be 5 drop off locations (listed below). You will want to take the collected bags to the drop off location that you are assigned. This will help to know if the teams have returned and if there are areas that will still need to be picked up.  There will be teams at each location to help unload your vehicle.

Within Bozeman:
* Smith's
* Bogert Park
* Town & Country - 11th Ave
* Rosauers

Within Belgrade:
* Town & Country

Donated Items:  We are on a mission to collect non-perishable food items and/or monetary donations
* Checks:  Checks should  be made out to "Gallatin Valley Food Bank"
* Food:  Non-perishable food items

Protocol for Days Activities
Expectations of Team Leaders
* Pickup lanyards and team information the morning of the event
* Manage your team
* Make sure food is collected throughout your assigned neighborhood(s)

* Please be safe.  Watch out for cars.  Keep an eye on children.  Etc!

Expectations of Team Members:

* Enjoy!

The final results will be emailed out to you following the event.

Surveys:
We will email out a link to a survey to all volunteers (please pass the survey along to your team members) in the weeks following the event. We look forward to your feedback on how we can improve next year’s event.
