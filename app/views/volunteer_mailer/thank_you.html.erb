    <p>First of all, we would like to thank you for your dedication and commitment to this exciting event! We are looking forward to the 8th Annual Spring For Food - Food Drive and hope to achieve our goal of raising 20,000 pounds of food!   Below is a detailed outline of what to expect related to the event:</p>

    <h3>Day of the event: April 7th, 2018</h3>
    <p><b>Time of Event:</b> The event will officially begin at 10am and last until you finish (2-3 hrs).</p>

    <p><b>Check-in Time and Location:</b>  Due to the amount of coordination, we ask that all team leaders show up at between 9:30am-10:30am to collect their lanyards/badges at their assigned drop off location.  We will let you know your drop-off location a week or so before the event.</p>

    <p><b>Lanyards:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lanyards with volunteer badges will be distributed the day of the event. Please wear these throughout the morning and ensure they are visible (should be worn on the outside of your jacket/coat).</li>
      <li>We would like to collect the lanyards at the end of the event and there will be a "Lanyard Return" box at your designated drop off location</li>
Maps
      <li>Maps were sent to you by email.  Please print a copy of the map for your team members.  The Drop-off locations will have copies of the maps, but it will be easier if you have your printed copy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Emergency Phone number:</b></p>
    <p>In the event of emergency, please call one of the Event Leads:</p>

    </ul>


    <p><b>Team structure:</b>  Teams can range in size from two people to however many you want â€“four- five people per team has been recommended in past years.  Ideally, there would be one "designated driver" to help transport all of the food that is collected.  Please be sure to keep in touch with your team throughout the event.   Please feel free to take more than one pick up area if your team size allows.</p>

    <p><b>Drop-Off Locations:</b> There will be 5 drop off locations (listed below). You will want to take the collected bags to the drop off location that you are assigned. This will help to know if the teams have returned and if there are areas that will still need to be picked up.  There will be teams at each location to help unload your vehicle.</p>
