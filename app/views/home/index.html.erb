		<p>Invite your family and friends to join you on a crisp December day of giving back to your community. In its first year, the event raised 14,000 pounds of food and $2,000 for the Gallatin Valley Food Bank. This year, we have set our sights on becoming the Valley's biggest food drive by tripling our impact and raising 45,000 pounds of food. A contribution of this size equates to 5% of the Gallatin Valley Food Bank's annual supply and compliments the US Postal Service Food Drive that occurs in April.</p>
