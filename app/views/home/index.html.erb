    <h2>Come and join us</h2>
    <div class="prepend-2 span-20 append-2 last">
      <p>It’s easy to get involved.  Invite your family and friends to join you on April 6th to collect food at one of ten grocery stores in our area. Your contribution will support over 1,200 local families that receive emergency food boxes each month, not to mention specific programs like KidsPack and Kids’ Pantries, which help prevent hunger in our most vulnerable citizens. This year’s Spring for Food Drive has a companion event: Childhood Hunger Awareness Week. This means we’re going to do it a little differently.</p>
      <p>If you’ve volunteered or donated in the past, then you know that Spring for Food is usually a door-to-door collection process. That’s changing this year. We’re setting up central donation points at every supermarket in Bozeman and Belgrade so that people can donate as they’re shopping. To volunteer click <%= link_to('HERE', 'https://hrdc9.galaxydigital.com/need/?s=1&need_init_id=1458') %></p>
      <p>In addition, we hope to have a donation bin at every school, from Wednesday, April 3rd until Wednesday, April 10th (<%= link_to('Wear Orange Wednesday', 'http://serve.mt.gov/ServeMT/fight-childhood-hunger/fight-childhood-hunger-week') %>), so that kids can participate as well. We think this will streamline the process and boost donations. With your family’s help, we can drastically reduce childhood hunger in our community and ensure that the food bank is able to provide healthy food to anyone who needs it. Check back for a list of participating schools.</p>

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <div class="prepend-2 span-20 append-2 last">
      <p>Please fill out the volunteer form below and select a grocery store close to where you live. Volunteers are encouraged to pull together a small group of friends and family to join them in making this event a huge success.</p>
      <p>What we are asking:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Before the Event:</strong> Sign up on the form below to register at one of ten local grocery stores for a two-hour shift. This is a large volunteer effort, so please make sure you are available at the time you sign up for, as rescheduling will be a challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>The Day of the Event:</strong> Show up at the supermarket you’ve signed up for. Employees of the food bank or volunteers from the previous shift will provide training. Volunteers will be responsible for handing out wish lists of desired donation items and receiving donations in our watermelon bins.</li>
        <li><strong>After the Event:</strong> As the food drive winds down, a truck or van will come to your location to pick up our food bins. The final volunteer shift (2 PM - 4:15 PM) will be responsible for waiting until the truck arrives. We expect all pick-up vehicles to arrive before 4:15 but, if you are on the last shift, make sure your schedule is flexible in case there are unanticipated delays.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Monetary Donation:</h3>
      <p>If you would like to donate some money towards this year's food drive, you can do so through the <%= link_to('Gallatin Valley Food Bank\'s secure website', 'https://gallatinvalleyfoodbank.org/give-help/') %>.</p>

        <li>16% of households are single parent families, 34% of households have at least one child, 13% are 55 or older, and 287 are veterans.</li>
        <li>During the 2016-2017 fiscal year end the Gallatin Valley Food Bank distributed 2,000,486 pounds of food.</li>
        <li>Out of the total, 136,613 pounds of food went to other area non-profits, the Community Café, CSFP and KidsPack. All this took an extraordinary effort by hundreds of volunteers and dedicated staff.</li>
        <li>Volunteers are vital to fighting hunger. Our volunteers are the backbone of our efforts, during the last fiscal year our volunteers contributed tens of thousands of hours to help alleviate hunger in the Gallatin Valley.
